### Projects:
* [Sip 'N Chip](https://github.com/bsponny/SipNChip)
	* This is a web app developed with Django, with a team, for a mini golf course. This web app provides the customers with an ability to sign up for tournaments, keep score while playing, and order drinks from the bar during play. This also allows management to create tournaments and manage users and provides the bartenders with the drink order and what hole the player is on who ordered the drink.

* [Handi](https://github.com/bsponny/handi)
	* This Django web app is to provide people in the Deaf Community a place to connect with one another. This is also an app that allows people, both hearing and deaf, to learn American Sign Language. This will be done with a mentor, who is fluent in ASL to help the user along their learning journey.

* [SponCoWeb](https://github.com/bsponny/SponCoWeb)
	* This is a website built for the accounting firm, Sponenburgh & Co.
